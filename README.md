## What is Turtle Game?
In Python, there is a library which is called as turtle and it is really usefull, easy to use. When I learn this I want to design a basic turtle game.
	Purpose:  Feeding the turtle with healthy food.

	Rules: Green food +1 point red food -1 point, If the turtle's score drops below 0, it's game over.

### Features:
• You can increase or decrease the speed of the turtle

• You can pause and restart the game by pressing P.

• You can move the turtle with the arrow keys.

• If the turtle eats green food, its size increases, if it eats red, it decreases.
